## Introduction

A service that provides a clustering storage of metadata for Data Integration purposes.
Optimized for fast storage and retrieval performance.

This project has three subprojects:

* `util` -- A library with utilities to convert and normalize XML, JSON and MARC.
* `server` -- The reservoir storage server. This is the FOLIO module: mod-reservoir
* `client` -- A client for sending ISO2709/MARCXML records to the server.

## Compilation

Requirements:

* Java 24 (other versions might not work with graalvm)
* Maven 3.6.3 or later
* Docker (unless `-DskipTests` is used)

You need `JAVA_HOME` set, e.g.:

   * Linux: `export JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f /usr/bin/javac | sed "s:bin/javac::")`
   * macOS: `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)`

Build all components with: `mvn install`

## Native image

You must install [sdkman](https://sdkman.io) first. Then perform

    . $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
    sdk install java 24.0.1-graalce
    . $HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh
    mvn -Pnative package

Two images are created in the native profile:

    server/target/reservoir-native
    client/target/client-native

## Server

You will need Postgres 12 or later.

You can create an empty database and a user with, e.g:

```
CREATE DATABASE folio_modules;
CREATE USER folio WITH CREATEROLE PASSWORD 'folio';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE folio_modules TO folio;
```

The server's database connection is then configured by setting environment variables:
`DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_DATABASE`,
`DB_MAXPOOLSIZE`, `DB_SERVER_PEM`.

Once configured, start the server with:

```
java -Dport=8081 --upgrade-module-path=server/target/compiler \
   -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+EnableJVMCI \
   -jar server/target/mod-reservoir-server-fat.jar
```

## Server metrics

Reservoir can produce Prometheus and JMX metrics. Prometheus metrics are exposed on the path `/metrics` and port `PORT` if the `-Dmetrics.prometheus.port=PORT` option is specified.
JMX metrics are exposed for domain `reservoir` if `-Dmetrics.jmx=true` option is specified.

## Running with Docker

If you feel adventurous and want to run Reservoir in a Docker container, build the container first:

```
docker build -t mod-reservoir:latest .
```

And run with the server port exposed (`8081` by default):

```
docker run -e DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
  -e DB_USERNAME=folio \
  -e DB_PASSWORD=folio \
  -e DB_DATABASE=folio_modules \
  -p 8081:8081 --name reservoir mod-reservoir:latest
```

**Note**: The magic host `host.docker.internal` is required to access the DB and may be only available in Docker Desktop.
If it's not defined you can specify it by passing `--add-host=host.docker.internal:<docker bridge net IP>` to the run command.

**Note**: Those docker build and run commands do work as-is with [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima).

## Command-line client

Note: the CLI is no longer developed and the file upload functionality is now available from
curl (see below) so please use this instead.

The client is a command-line tool for sending records to the mod-reservoir server.

Run the client with:

```
java -jar client/target/mod-reservoir-client-fat.jar [options] [files...]
```

To see list options use `--help`. The client uses environment variables
`OKAPI_URL`, `OKAPI_TENANT`, `OKAPI_TOKEN` for Okapi URL, tenant and
token respectively.

Before records can be pushed, the database needs to be prepared for the tenant.
If Okapi is used, then the usual `install` command will do it, but if the
mod-reservoir module is being run on its own, then that must be done manually.

For example, to prepare the database for tenant `diku` on server running on localhost:8081, use:

```
export OKAPI_TENANT=diku
export OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:8081
java -jar client/target/mod-reservoir-client-fat.jar --init
```

**Note**: The above-mentioned commands are for the server running on localhost.
For a secured server, the `-HX-Okapi-Token:$OKAPI_TOKEN` is required rather
than `X-Okapi-Tenant`.

To purge the data, use:

```
export OKAPI_TENANT=diku
export OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:8081
java -jar client/target/mod-reservoir-client-fat.jar --purge
```

To send MARCXML to the same server with defined `sourceId`, use:

```
export OKAPI_TENANT=diku
export OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:8081
export sourceid=lib1
java -jar client/target/mod-reservoir-client-fat.jar \
  --source $sourceid \
  --xsl xsl/localid.xsl \
  client/src/test/resources/record10.xml
```

The option `--xsl` may be repeated for a sequence of transformations.

Once records are loaded, they can be retrieved with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/records
```

## Ingest record files

The endpoint `/reservoir/upload` allows uploading files via HTTP `PUT` and `POST`.

Currently, two formats are supported.

 * MARC/ISO2709 concatenated records, triggered by Content-Type `application/octet-stream`.
 * MARCXML collection, triggered by Content-Type `application/xml` or `text/xml`.

The following query parameters are recognized:

 * `sourceId`: required parameter for specifying the source identifier.
 * `sourceVersion`: optional parameter for specifying source version
    (default is 1)
 * `fileName`: optional parameter for specifying the name of the uploaded file
 * `localIdPath`: optional parameter for specifying where to find local identifier
    (default is `$.marc.fields[*].001`)
 * `xmlFixing`: optional boolean parameter, if `true` an attempt is made to remove invalid characters (e.g control chars)
    from the XML input, `false` by default

These query parameters are for debugging and performance testing only:

 * `ingest` optional boolean parameter to determine whether ingesting is to take place (default `true`)
 * `raw` optional boolean parameter to determine whether to just pipe the stream (default `false`)

Note that this endpoint expects granular permissions for ingesting records from a particular source:

 * `reservoir-upload.source.*` to ingest records from a specific source, where `*` symbol must be replaced
    by the `sourceId` parameter
 * `reservoir-upload.all-sources` to ingest data for any source (admin permission).

 These permissions are enforced not by Okapi but by Reservoir directly and hence must be specified through
 the `X-Okapi-Permissions` header if the request is performed directly against the module. This is achieved
 by adding `-H'X-Okapi-Permissions:["reservoir-upload.all-sources"]'` switch to the curl commands below.

For uploading ISO2709 (binary MARC) use:

```
  curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
    -T records.mrc $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/upload?sourceId=BIB1
```

Note: curl's `-T` is a shorthand for `--upload-file` and uses `PUT` for uploads,
no `Content-Type` is set by curl which Reservoir treats the same as `application/octet-stream`.

For uploading MARCXML:

```
  curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-Type:text/xml \
    -T records100k.xml $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/upload?sourceId=BIB1
```

In order to send `gzip` compressed files use:

```
  curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-Encoding:gzip \
   -T records.mrc.gz $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/upload?sourceId=BIB1
```

or apply compression on the fly:

```
  cat records.mrc | gzip | curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
    -HContent-Encoding:gzip -T - $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/upload?sourceId=BIB1
```

Avoid using curl's alternative with `--data-binary @...` for large files as it buffers the entire file and may result in out of memory errors.

## Ingest via multipart/form-data

An alternative to the method above is uploading with `multipart/form-data` content type at `/reservoir/upload` endpoint.

Only the named form input `records` is recognized; other form inputs are ignored.

For example to ingest a set of MARCXML records via curl from sourceId `BIB1`:

```
  curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -Frecords=@records100k.xml $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/upload?sourceId=BIB1
```

This approach does not allow for `gzip` compression but is simpler to integrate with a regular browser.

## Ingest via an embedded upload form

Reservoir comes with a simple HTML/JS file upload form that can be accessed by a browser at:
(when running Reservoir locally)

```
  http://localhost:8081/reservoir/upload-form
```

When running behind Okapi you need to use the `invoke` URL:

```
  http://$OKAPI_URL/_/invoke/tenant/$OKAPI_TENANT/reservoir/upload-form/
```

in order to pass the tenant identifier (trailing slash is important).

## Configuring matchers

Records in Reservoir are clustered according to rules expressed in a `matcher`. Matchers
can be implemented using `jsonpath`, for simple matching rules, or `javascript` for arbitrary
complexity.

To configure a matcher, first load an appropriate code module, e.g a simple `jsonpath`
module with a matcher that works for __Marc-in-Json__ payload could be defined like this:

```
cat title-matcher.json
{
  "id": "title-matcher",
  "type": "jsonpath",
  "script": "$.marc.fields[*].245.subfields[*].a"
}
```

Post it to the server with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-type:application/json \
 $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/modules -d @title-matcher.json
```

Next, create a pool and reference this matcher to apply the method for clustering:

```
cat title-pool.json
{
  "id": "title",
  "matcher": "title-matcher",
  "update": "ingest"
}
```

Post the pool configuration to the server with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-type:application/json \
 $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/matchkeys -d @title-pool.json
```

and then initialize the pool for this config:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -XPUT $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/matchkeys/title/initialize
```

Now, you can retrieve individual record clusters from this pool with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/clusters?matchkeyid=title
```

Obviously, matcher configuration must be aligned with the format of stored records.

Reservoir ships with a JS module that implements the `goldrush` matching
algorithm from coalliance.org.

```
cat js/matchkeys/goldrush/goldrush-conf.json
{
  "id": "goldrush-matcher",
  "type": "javascript",
  "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/folio-org/mod-reservoir/master/js/matchkeys/goldrush/goldrush.mjs"
}
```

Load it with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-type:application/json \
 $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/modules -d @js/matchkeys/goldrush/goldrush-conf.json
```

And create a corresponding pool with:

```
cat goldrush-pool.json
{
  "id": "goldrush",
  "matcher": "goldrush-matcher::matchkey",
  "update": "ingest"
}
```
post:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-type:application/json \
 $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/matchkeys -d @goldrush-pool.json
```

## OAI-PMH client

The OAI-PMH client is executing in the server. It is an alternative to
ingesting records via the command-line client mentioned earlier.
Commands are sent to the server to initiate the client operations.

### OAI-PMH client configuration

The OAI-PMH client is configured by posting simple JSON configuration.
The identifier `id` is user-defined and given in the initial post.
Example with identifier `us-mdbj` below:

```
export OKAPI_TENANT=diku
export OKAPI_URL=http://localhost:8081
cat oai-us-mdbj.json
{
  "id": "us-mdbj",
  "set": "397",
  "sourceId": "US-MDBJ",
  "url": "https://pod.stanford.edu/oai",
  "metadataPrefix": "marc21",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer ey.."
  }
}
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-Type:application/json -XPOST \
   -d@oai-us-mdbj.json $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients
```

In this case, all ingested records from the client are given the source identifier `US-MDBJ`.

See [schema](server/src/main/resources/openapi/schemas/oaiPmhClient.json) for more information.

This configuration can be inspected with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/us-mdbj
```

Start a job with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -XPOST \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/us-mdbj/start
```

Start all jobs with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -XPOST \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/_all/start
```

Each job will continue until the server returns error or returns no resumption token. The `from`
property of the configuration is populated with latest datestamp in records received. This enables
the client to repeat the job again at a later date to fetch updates from `from` to now (unless `until` is
specified).

Get status for a job with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/us-mdbj/status
```

Get status for all jobs with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/_all/status
```

Stop a job with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -XPOST \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/us-mdbj/stop
```

Stop all jobs with:
```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -XPOST \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/pmh-clients/_all/stop
```

## OAI-PMH server

The path prefix for the OAI server is `/reservoir/oai` and requires no access permissions.

The following OAI-PMH verbs are supported by the server: `ListIdentifiers`, `ListRecords`, `GetRecord`, `Identify`.

At this stage, only `metadataPrefix` with value `marcxml` is supported. This
parameter can be omitted, in which case `marcxml` is assumed.

Each Reservoir cluster corresponds to an OAI-PMH record and each matchkey configuration corresponds to
an OAI `set`.

For example, to initiate a harvest of "title" clusters:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT "$OKAPI_URL/reservoir/oai?verb=ListRecords&set=title"
```

and to retrieve a particular OAI-PMH record (Reservoir cluster):

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT \
  "$OKAPI_URL/reservoir/oai?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:<cluster UUID>"
```

Since no permissions are required for `/reservoir/oai`, the endpoint can be accessed without the need for
the `X-Okapi-Tenant` and `X-Okapi-Token` headers using the invoke feature of Okapi:

```
curl "$OKAPI_URL/_/invoke/tenant/$OKAPI_TENANT/reservoir/oai?set=title&verb=ListRecords"

```
Note: this obviously only works if Okapi is proxying requests to the module

The OAI server delivers 1000 identifiers/records at a time. This limit can be
increased with a non-standard query parameter `limit`. The service returns resumption token
until the full set is retrieved.

The OAI-PMH server returns MarcXML and expects that the payload provides MARC-in-JSON format under the `marc` key.

## Transformers

Payloads can be converted or normalized using JavaScript Transformers during export.

Example transformer:

```
cat js/transformers/marc-transformer.mjs
        export function transform(clusterStr) {
          let cluster = JSON.parse(cluster);
          let recs = cluster.records;
          //merge all marc recs
          const out = {};
          out.leader = 'new leader';
          out.fields = [];
          for (let i = 0; i < recs.length; i++) {
            let rec = recs[i];
            let marc = rec.payload.marc;
            //collect all marc fields
            out.fields.push(marc.fields);
            //stamp with custom 999 for each member
            out.fields.push(
              {
                '999' :
                {
                  'ind1': '1',
                  'ind2': '0',
                  'subfields': [
                    {'i': rec.globalId },
                    {'l': rec.localId },
                    {'s': rec.sourceId }
                  ]
                }
              }
            );
          }
          return JSON.stringify(out);
}
```

Transformers just like matchers are `code modules` and the above marc transformer
can be installed with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-Type:application/json \
  $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/modules -d @js/transformers/marc-transformer.json
```

and enabled for the OAI-PMH server with:

```
curl -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT -HContent-Type:application/json \
  -XPUT $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/config/oai -d'{"transformer":"marc-transformer::transform"}'
```

If a transformer is modified to produce a different result for a particular source,
the clusters that include records from this source should be marked for re-export by having their datestamps updated.
This can be achieved with the following call:

```
curl -G -HX-Okapi-Tenant:$OKAPI_TENANT $OKAPI_URL/reservoir/clusters/touch \
  --data-urlencode "query=matchkeyId = title AND sourceId = BIB1" -XPOST
```

## Hosting notes

Harvest operations against slow OAI-PMH servers may take a long time and appear idle which can cause timeouts in NAT gateways or firewalls.

Reservoir enables _TCP keepalive_ for client sockets in an attempt to workaround OAI-PMH idle resets. The following values are used:

  * `tcp_keepalive_idle` `45s`
  * `tcp_keepalive_interval` `45s`
  * `tcp_keepalive_count` (default, 9)

which are below the default idle timeout values (~300s).

Similarly, certain Reservoir API operations, including:

  * `/config/matchkeys/{name}/initialize`
  * `/clusters/?matchkeyid={name}&count=exact`

are database heavy and may take a long time. Such request may be considered idle by the front load-balancer
or ingress controller and require tuning of the timeout values.

Specifically, for NGINX it's recommended that the read timeout is increased beyond the default 60s:

```
proxy_read_timeout 600s
```

Additionally to allow uploading large files, it's a good idea to disable request buffering in NGINX and
increase the max size:

```
proxy_request_buffering off
client_max_body_size 10G
```

In `ingress-nginx` the following annotations should be used:

```
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: 10G
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: "600"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-request-buffering: "off"
```
